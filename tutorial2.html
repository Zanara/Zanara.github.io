    <h1>Wavelength Switched Optical Networks</h1>
    <p>Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) are Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
      based networks that include switching elements that can switch based on the wavelength or the 
      frequency of signals transported over optical fiber. Although originally included in the overall set of 
      Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) based control plane protocols, optical technology 
      developments have gone beyond the optical systems originally envisioned within GMPLS. Hence this work 
      extended GMPLS and related technologies, in particular, the path computation element (PCE) to 
      provide robust control of these more modern optical networks.</p>
